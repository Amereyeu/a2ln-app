# Android 2 Linux Notifications App
**Android 2 Linux Notifications** is a way to show your Android phone notifications on your Linux desktop using libnotify. It creates a direct socket connection to your PC whenever a notification arrives. **Therefore your phone and your PC must be in the same network.**
## Notes on Specific Phones
### Huawei
The notification listener might be disabled sometimes because of Huawei's strict energy saving methods. To encounter this problem, go to *Settings* > *Battery* > *App launch*, select *Android 2 Linux Notifications* and enable the bottom two options.
