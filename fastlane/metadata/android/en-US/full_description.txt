<b>Which Host Do I Have to Enter?</b>
You have to give the address of the computer that runs the <a href="https://github.com/patri9ck/a2ln-server">A2LN server</a> to the app.
It can be found out by using <code>ip route</code> in your terminal for example:
<pre>
$ ip route
default via 192.168.178.1 dev wlp39s0 proto dhcp metric 600
192.168.178.0/24 dev wlp39s0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.178.41 metric 600
</pre>
As you can see, the host address is <code>192.168.178.41</code> in this case.
