<b>Which Host Do I Have to Enter?</b>
<ul>
<li>
When you start the <a href="https://github.com/patri9ck/a2ln-server">A2LN server</a>, the host is shown:
<pre>
Address: 192.168.178.41:6000
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Alternatively, you can find it out by using ip route in your terminal for example:
<pre>
$ ip route
default via 192.168.178.1 dev wlp39s0 proto dhcp metric 600
192.168.178.0/24 dev wlp39s0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.178.41 metric 600
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
With both methods, we can see that the host is <code>192.168.178.41</code> in this case.
